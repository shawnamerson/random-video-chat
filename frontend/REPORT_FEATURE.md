# User Report Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a complete user reporting system that allows users to report inappropriate behavior during video chats.

## What Was Added

### 1. **ReportModal Component** (`app/components/ReportModal.tsx`)
- Professional modal dialog for reporting users
- Predefined report reasons:
  - Inappropriate content
  - Harassment
  - Spam
  - Nudity
  - Violence or threats
  - Underage user
  - Other (with custom text input)
- Form validation
- Mobile-responsive design

### 2. **Report Functionality in useWebRTC Hook**
- `reportUser(reason: string)` - Sends report to backend
- `hasPeer` - Tracks if user has an active partner
- Socket event listeners:
  - `report-submitted` - Confirms successful report
  - `banned` - Notifies user if they've been banned

### 3. **Report Button in UI**
- Red "ðŸš« Report" button in control panel
- Desktop: Shows full text "ðŸš« Report"
- Mobile: Shows icon only "ðŸš«"
- Disabled when no active partner
- Opens modal when clicked

### 4. **Backend Integration**
Server already handles:
- Storing reports in Redis (24-hour expiry)
- Auto-ban after 5 reports within 24 hours
- Tracking report details (IP, reason, timestamp)
- Admin dashboard to view/manage reports

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User is paired with another user in video chat
2. Report button becomes enabled
3. User clicks "Report" button
4. Modal appears with report reasons
5. User selects reason (or enters custom text for "Other")
6. User submits report
7. Success message appears: "âœ… Report submitted..."
8. Report is stored in backend

### Auto-Ban System
- Reports tracked per IP address
- 5 reports within 24 hours â†’ automatic ban
- Banned users receive "banned" event
- Connection terminated for banned users

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `app/components/ReportModal.tsx` - Modal component
- `app/components/ReportModal.module.css` - Modal styles
- `REPORT_FEATURE.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `app/page.tsx` - Added report button and modal
- `app/hooks/useWebRTC.ts` - Added report functionality
- `app/page.module.css` - Added report button styles

## Testing

### Local Testing
1. Run the frontend: `npm run dev`
2. Open two browser windows/tabs
3. Connect both to chat
4. Click "Report" button on one
5. Select a reason and submit
6. Check admin dashboard for the report

### Verify Backend
Open admin dashboard:
1. Go to `admin-login.html`
2. Enter password: `KMAceacla3243@#$`
3. Click "Load Reports"
4. Should see the test report

## Deployment

### Push to Git
```bash
cd C:\Users\shawn\random-video-chat\frontend
git add .
git commit -m "Add user report feature with modal and auto-ban system"
git push origin main
```

### Vercel Auto-Deploy
- Vercel will automatically deploy when you push to main
- No configuration changes needed
- Report feature will be live immediately

## Admin Dashboard

View reports at:
- `admin-login.html` (local)
- Password: `KMAceacla3243@#$`
- API Key: (set in Digital Ocean)

Features:
- View all reports grouped by IP
- See report count per user
- Ban users directly from reports
- Clear reports for specific IPs
- View ban list with reasons

## Security

**Two-Layer Protection:**
1. **Frontend validation** - Prevents empty/invalid reports
2. **Backend validation** - Verifies peer relationship, validates data

**Rate Limiting:**
- Reports only allowed for current partner
- Can't report if not paired
- Reports expire after 24 hours

**Privacy:**
- Reports stored by IP (not username/email)
- Admin sees IP addresses only
- Ban details include reason and timestamp

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Add report cooldown (prevent spam reporting)
- Email notifications for admins
- Appeal system for bans
- Report categories with severity levels
- Machine learning for pattern detection
- Screenshot/video evidence capture
